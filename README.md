`Challenge 1:` 

Map over the thingsArray to generate a `p` element for each item and render them on the page below the button

-----------------------------------------------------------------

`Challenge2:`

Add an event listener to the button so when it is clicked, it adds another thing to our array

Hint: use the array `length + 1` to determine the number of the "Thing" being added. Also, have you event listener `console.log(thingsArray)` after adding the new item to the array.
Spoiler: the page won't update when new things get added to the array!
